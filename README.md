## Instruction

### Create a Character

1. Press the "Create new character" button to open the creation form.
2. Input the mouse name, swap two randomly generated abilities, and choose your first weapon. If one of the abilities is too low, you can also choose a bonus item.
3. Press "Create" to save your hero.

### Character Sheet

Main sheet includes few sections:

- **Name and Background:** Static and can't be changed.
- **Birthsign, Coat, and Look:** In the game process, you can change only the coat field.
- **Portrait:** Click on this empty block to upload an image (it must be a small file, no more than 2MB).
- **Level and Experience:** Here, you can see the hero's level and experience points. Click on the "+" button to open the Level Up window, where you can add some experience points to your character. Level Up can change abilities and HP. Once you click the "Add" button, you can't cancel it!
- **Abilities:** Displays current abilities and HP; you can change their temporary values.
- **Inventory:** Lists what your mouse is carrying, both on the body and in the backpack, along with wallet contents. Drag'n'drop to move items between cells. Note: Big items visually hide the second cell—keep an empty space for them. To remove an item, drag and drop it onto the field with the text "Drop item here to remove."
- **Hirelings:** This section is usually hidden. If you have hirelings, see their type, abilities, and inventory. They can all be managed, and you can remove a hireling by clicking on the "remove" button.

### Main menu

Here you can find controls and lists of game items and conditions.

- **Options:** In this section, you can save your character as a .json file, clear the list, and create or upload a character.
- **Items, Spells, and Conditions:** Click on a type to see the list of cards. Add cards to inventory via drag'n'drop. Also, you can click on "Add custom item" and create something custom—from a weapon to a large utility; it will not have a unique image.
- **Add Hireling:** By clicking on the button, you can create a new hireling of a specific type. It will be added to the "Hirelings" list.
- **Form Warband:** Click the button to create a warband. After that, you'll see a "Show Warband" button above the "Options" section. Easily manage and disband your warband from there.
- **Grits:** For characters at level 2 and above, use this section to deal with any negative conditions from your inventory.
- **Bank:** Store your items in the city here. Usually, there's a cost involved; check with your Game Master for details.
