# Mausritter online character-sheet

Mausritter is a role playing game by [Losing Games](https://losing.games/) - fast, simple and perfect for new players. You can find game rules here: https://mausritter.com.
This editor will help you to build and use your character in game, especially if you play online.

This is the demo version of app, and it does not contain all images (including character portraits), information/error messages and pdf download option (but you can use the browser's "print page" function).

Currently, you can create a new mouse, manipulate with items and hirelings, level up, and save/load character as .json file.

If you notice any bug or have an idea to update the app, please contact me: [brightsdays](https://brightsdays.github.io/contacts).
