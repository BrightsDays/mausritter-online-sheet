### Character Sheet

Main sheet includes few sections:

- **Name and Background:** Static and can't be changed.
- **Birthsign, Coat, and Look:** In the game process, you can change only the coat field.
- **Portrait:** Click on this empty block to upload an image (it must be a small file, no more than 2MB).
- **Level and Experience:** Here you can see the hero's level and experience points. Click on the "+" button to open the Level Up window, where you can add some experience points to your character. Level up can change abilities and HP, and after clicking the "Add" button, you can't cancel it!
- **Abilities:** Here you can see current abilities and HP and change their temporal value.
- **Inventory:** Lists all that your mouse has on the body and in the backpack, and pips in your wallet. Move items between cells by drag'n'drop. Note: Big items hide the second cell only visually—save an empty space for them. To remove an item, drag and drop it onto the field with the text "Drop item here to remove."
- **Hirelings:** Mostly this section is hidden. If you have some hireling, you can see their type, abilities, and inventory. They all can be managed, and you can remove a hireling by clicking on the "remove" button.

### Main menu

Here you can find controls and lists of game items and conditions.

- **Options:** In this section, you can save your character as a .json file, clear the list, and create or upload a character.
- **Items, Spells, and Conditions:** Click on a type to see the list of cards. Add cards to inventory via drag'n'drop. Also, you can click on "Add custom item" and create something custom—from a weapon to a big utility; it will not have a unique image.
- **Add Hireling:** By clicking on the button, you can create a new hireling of a specific type. It will be added to the "Hirelings" list.
- **Form Warband:** By clicking on the button, you can form a warband; after this, a "Show warband" button will be added above the "Options" section. Warband can be managed and disbanded.
- **Grits:** This section will be enabled only for characters of level 2 and more. It's a place to put some of your bad conditions from inventory.
- **Bank:** This section is a place to save your items in the city. Mostly it's not free; ask your Game Master about conditions.
